* *Disclaimers*:
- This GTD workflow for Neorg is opinionated, and derives from 3+ years of using GTD.
  It is a tradeoff between core GTD workflow and best practices found in notorious applications
  implementing GTD.
- Be aware that the lisibility of .norg files is important, but every part of the process should be
  done via special commands. That means there is no required direct user interaction in the files.

* GTD in Neorg

 ** Format

  *** Task format

   **** Generalities
        The format for a task is specified as follows (refering to {# Syntax}):
        /Note: the priority of the syntax is in this order/
        /Note2: if a task has subtasks, it is considered done as soon as all substasks are done/
        /Note3: You can go up to 6 subtask levels/

        @code norg
            #contexts §context_name§ §context_name§ ...
            #time.start §date§
            #time.due §date§
            #waiting.for
            - [ ] §Task description§
            -- [ ] §Subtask description§
        @end

   **** Standard contexts
        - Someday tasks are recognized with a context `someday`

   **** Working with dates
        The format for date is `YYYY-mm-dd`

  *** Top-level organization

      This is the proposed approach which is directly related to {# Organize}.
      - Every `.norg` file is just a placeholder.
      - The workspace allows an unlimited amount of nested folders, but they mean nothing except the
        meaning the user wants for them.

      One could create a workspace tree like this:

      @code
          .
          ├── index.norg
          ├── reference
          │   └── next_house.norg
          ├── personal
          │   └── moving_to_next_home.norg
          └── work
              └── reunion_5_mai.norg
      @end

      And another one could use GTD very lightly like this:

      @code
          .
          ├── active_projects.norg
          ├── next_actions.norg
          └── someday_maybe.norg
      @end

  *** Projects management

      {# Project} are represented via {:neorg:# headings}[headings] like so:

      @code norg
      
          #contexts §context_name§ §context_name§ ...
          #time.start §date§
          #time.due §date§
          * §Project name§
          - [ ] §Task description§
      @end

      Here is a more concrete example:

      @code norg
      * This is a project
      - [ ] This is a task inside a project
      
      * This is another project
      - [ ] This is a task inside the other project
      
      * This is a very large project
       ** This is a heading for the project
          - [ ] This is a task
       ** This is another heading for the project
          - [ ] This is a task
      @end

      You can see that we can create headings for a project. 
      In that way, we leverage neorg capabilities in order to divide tasks and content inside a
      project.

  *** Area Of Focus

      An {**** Area of Focus} (AOF) is made with a {:neorg:# markers}[marker] like so:

      @code norg
      | §Area Of Focus name§
      @end

      As markers (`|`) recognize everything below them as part of the markers, there's only one way
      to get out of an AOF, which is with an "un-named" marker. We suggest representing that as:

      @code norg
      | _
      @end

      Below is an example with AOF's:

      @code norg
      | This is an AOF
      
      * This is a project
      - [ ] This is a task inside a project
      
      * This is another project
      - [ ] This is a task inside the other project
      
      * This is a very large project
       ** This is a heading for the project
          - [ ] This is a task
       ** This is another heading for the project
          - [ ] This is a task
      
      | _
      
      This is not in an AOF
      @end

 ** GTD Structure for Neorg

  *** Capture
      This is the first stage of GTD, and it involves placing all ideas/things to do/notes/reminders
      in a centralized place, called /Inbox/.

      - Every task is by default created in `index.norg`. For a task to be marked as processed, it
      is required to have at least one context.

   **** Quick capture
        Capturing should not take longer than actually doing the task.
        Taking this into account, creating a task and putting it in Inbox should be very quick.
        A quick capture workflow should:
        - create a task on `<CR>`
        - allow to add more information to the task being written
        - be easy to open

  *** Clarify
      This part is what I commonly refer as:
      > Processing the inbox

      It is a set of actions to take in order to process what each task means. 
      A best practice is to process each task at a time, following a FIFO
      convention. We should design the user interaction with that in mind.

      We should allow the user to:
      - Modify/Add fields of the task
      - Delete the task (called *Eliminate*)
      - Move it to the someday/maybe list
      - Make it a reference, removing it from all GTD views and moving it to an external note.
      - Convert it to a project (see {*** Organize})

  *** Organize
      Where should all processed tasks go?

      The user should have a view to see:
      - All his next actions
      - All his projects
      -- entering on one should show him all of this project's tasks

      In this view we should be able to filter tasks.

   **** Area Of Focus
        An area of focus is nothing more than an abstraction of your life, like categories.
        They can contain projects.

   **** Project
        In GTD there is the concept of a project, which is something we must do in 2+ actions.
        If something requires only one action, we do not need a project for it.
        Current implementations introduce a concept of bullet list projects (or parallel tasks).

    ***** Sequential projects
          A sequential project is a project containing tasks that could be done in a sequential
          manner. That means the second task in this project could only be shown to the user after
          finishing the first task.

    ***** Bullet list projects
          A bullet list project is a project where all tasks can be done in parallel.
          That means the user can see every task in his user view at the same time.

   **** Next actions
        A next action is one of the following:
        - A task that is in a {# Bullet list projects}[bullet list project] and not in someday
        - The first task of a {# Sequential projects}[sequential project]
        That means it is the work we could do now.

   **** Changes from base GTD
    ***** Inbox list
          The inbox list is a set of all tasks and projects that are:
          - In the inbox list (default: `inbox.norg` file)
          - /Unclarified/, and not in inbox list
          -- For a task to be clarified, it should require at minima 1 context.
          -- For a project to be clarified, it should require at minima 1 task.
    ***** Context Lists
          There is no concept of context lists. Instead there are tags, e.g. `#contexts home`.
          Special contexts:
          - `#contexts today`: Marks a task to be done today, will have particular
          effects on {# Quick view}.
    ***** Projects List
          See {# Project}.
    ***** Someday List:
          A someday list is now a context called `@someday`.
          - `#contexts someday`: Prevent the task from showing in the {# Quick view}.

  *** Reflect
      This part of the process is the /review/ part, which is a set of tools to help the user regain
      clarity and focus on what needs to be done.

   **** Daily review
        The daily review is a process of shallowly reviewing:
        - What's been done yesterday
        - What's in the inbox (unclarified tasks and projects)

        No user interaction per se is necessary for this part.

   **** Weekly review
        The weekly review is a central place of GTD, and consists of reviewing everything.
        - Every week, ask the user to start a weekly review in order to keep track of things.

        Every step of {https://gettingthingsdone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Weekly_Review_Checklist.pdf}[GTD Weekly review] should be user interacted, and each step must present one
        after the other:
        - /Get Inbox to Zero/: {# Clarify}
        - Review action lists: Open a view to see all contexts (except `#waiting.for` and `#contexts someday`)
        - Review waiting for lists: Open a view to see all `#waiting.for` tasks
        - Review projects lists: Open a view to see all projects, with options to see their tasks
        - Review someday/maybe list: Open a view to see all `#contexts someday` tasks

        The weekly review is done when all steps are done.

  *** Engage
      This is the part when we go to see what to do and tick off the tasks.

   **** Quick view
        What we call quick view is a sort of dashboard comprising:
        - Today's tasks
        - Assigned for today with `#contexts today`
        - Starting today (with `#time.start`)
        - Due today (with `#time.due`)
        - Calendar for next 7 days (with due dates)
        - Adding a task to the inbox
        - Opening a particular project view
        - Opening a particular context view (or next actions)
        - Doing a weekly review
